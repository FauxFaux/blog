Following the <a href="http://www.uwcs.co.uk/">CompSoc</a> <a href="http://gallery.uwcs.co.uk/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album04">BFL 2006</a> and a week at home, I've moved to the Southampton area for my <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/employment/uk/students/it.html">IT year</a> at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> Hursley.

Not having had an internet connection for most of that time, I've had to come up with some other things to do (besides watching <a href="http://www.qi.com/tv/">QI</a>).

First, anyone who's used <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm">GnuWin32's CoreUtils' ls</a> will probably have noticed how slow it was (for example, it takes ~4 seconds to list the files on my desktop); it also lacks actual checking of the owner/group of the file, the permissions and the colouring/console-width-awareness provided on other platforms. I can (now) appreciate the permissions, but the others.. Anyway, I decided to rewrite it. Going reasonably well, but reading the permissions (for anyone but the current user) is a <em>pain</em>. A <em>serious pain</em>.. if I ever manage to do it successfully, I'll probably write about it. As far as I can tell, nobody else has ever managed it, so things aren't looking good.

It's not ready for general use yet, but it's definitely working:

Secondly, having seen both <a href="http://twpol.dyndns.org/">Silver</a>'s <a href="http://twpol.dyndns.org/temp/ConResMgr.exe">ConResMgr</a> (a tool that lets you drag-resize Windows Command Prompt windows), and the way he lays out windows on his screen, I thought I'd have a go at doing it semi-automatically.

The result was the imaginitively 'FauWM Assistant', which, when you Ctrl+drag or Ctrl+resize windows will show a dialog prompting you for which <abbr title="Quadrant, but with six instead of four.">sextant(s)</abbr> of which screen(s) you'd like the window to be placed in.

The result is that it's very easy to get a window setup that looks something like:

<a href="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/perm/haxwm.png"><img style="width: 400px" src="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/perm/haxwmp.png" /></a>

The (ultimately sexy) prompt for window position currently looks like:

So, to use:

<ul>	<li>Grab (pretty much) any window by the title bar, I know it doesn't work with <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a> and (partially) <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a>.</li>
	<li>Hold control and just drop the window anywhere; the Segment Select.. window shown above will come up under your cursor.</li>
	<li>Drag a box through some of the rectangles shown.</li>
	<li>The window should now be where you wanted it.</li>
</ul>

You can <a href="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/fauwma.exe">download FauWM Assistant</a> (<a href="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/fauwma.exe.asc">sig</a>), it needs the <a href="http://blog.prelode.com/?page_id=41">Visual Studio 2005 (8) Runtime Library</a>.
