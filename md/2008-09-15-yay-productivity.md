I (finally) have a job, and, suddenly, (I'm sure it's unrelated) start feeling relatively productive outside of work.

I'm trying to learn the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak keyboard layout</a> again, I've produced a version of <a href="http://b.goeswhere.com/colemauk.exe">Colemak with more UK symbol keys</a> (self extractor) (<a href="http://b.goeswhere.com/colemauk.exe.asc">.asc</a>) on (for example, ", @, Â¬ in the right places). <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8be579aa-780d-4253-9e0a-e17e51db2223">MSKLC 1.4</a> source included, should work on XP and Vista.

I wrote a tool a while ago for a friend show whether drives were spun up or not. I just changed it to a little tray applet:

It also notifies you when drives spin down and up. Currently it operates by polling, at a hardcoded 15s interval. Feel free to change the source.
