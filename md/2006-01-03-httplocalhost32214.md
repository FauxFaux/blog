I noticed today that <a href="http://localhost:32214">http://localhost:32214</a> had enqueued itself in <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a>.. I have no idea when or why it happened, due to not getting near the bottom of my playlist very often, but.. what is it? Random open ports on a pc isn't normally a good sign.

A bit of investigation suggests that it's the <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/player.php">player</a>, which is strange. 

<a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> has radio links on their site, but they're all done using a custom protocol, for instance <a href="lastfm://user/Faux/loved">lastfm://user/Faux/loved</a>, so it apparently isn't those.

Launching the player, then immediately hitting the "Play <a href="http://localhost:32214">http://localhost:32214</a>" button causes something slightly strange to happen.. you get what appears to be a "200 OK" from the address in Winamp, then nothing.
<a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a>, not getting anything from the station, gets bored and goes on to the next track, no surprise there.

The surprise comes when you try and use the <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> player after this.. it doesn't work. It repeatedly comes up with "There is not enough content left to play this station.". I wonder how secure and stable the minihttpd they're using is? If the port's externally accessible, and they're expecting you to run the player full time, this could be a bit of an issue?

Also, I wonder what's going on, and if the last.fm's protocol is flexible enough to write a mini-proxy based on <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/player/">their source</a> allowing you to use <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a> to handle the lastfm:// links.

Either way, opening random ports on people's machines without explanation is bad, mmkay?
