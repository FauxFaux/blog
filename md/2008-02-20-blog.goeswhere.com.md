I'd have thought that it'd be reasonably reasonable to expect the following code to compile:
<pre>
enum Compass
{
	North(West), East(North), South(East), West(South);

	private final Compass clockwise_of;

	Compass(Compass clockwise_of)
	{
		this.clockwise_of = clockwise_of;
	}
}</pre>

It doesn't; "West" is used before it's declared.

So, how about this?

<pre>
enum Compass2
{
	North(new Object() { Compass2 ref() { return West; } }.ref()), East(North), South(East), West(South);

	private final Compass2 clockwise_of;

	Compass2(Compass2 clockwise_of)
	{
		this.clockwise_of = clockwise_of;
	}
}
</pre>

That's fine. Thanks, Java Language Spec!

Now, if only I didn't need four parameters to the constructor...
