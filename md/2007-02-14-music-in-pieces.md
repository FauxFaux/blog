I was involved in a discussion a few days ago about my favourite track featuring a guitar.. and I realised that I really don't listen to anything with guitars in. All of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Faux">the music I listen to</a> tends to lack guitars, and, in fact, stringed instruments of any kind (I'm including the piano here).

Further than that, it tends to lack instruments that I can't distinguish between whilst it's playing. To pick an extreme (aha) example, <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/track/87804acf-21a9-49cf-bdb9-9259db0375e1.html" title="Show track at MusicBrainz"><b>Straight Ahead (Hardcore remix)</b></a> ( sample: <a href="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/perm/TaB-SAhr.ogg" title="The first ten seconds of Tube & Berger's Straight Ahead (Hardcore remix). I believe that this, as a limited-quality (well, lossless) sample of the track is covered under fair-use, or it's equivalent over here. ;)">as .ogg</a> ), despite sounding awfully chaotic, contains "clearly" distinguishable instruments (I count seven), each of which are on their own "channel".

When I say "clearly", I mean that you <strong>can</strong> work it out, not that it's easy to do so. It takes me a depressingly long time. I'm using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file"><abbr title="Modular (music)">MOD</abbr></a> definition of "channels", ie. if you have a set of audio samples (snippets), you can only have one playing on any given channel at a time.

This raises a couple of interesting (at least, for me) questions:
<ul>	<li>Can you teach a computer to take it back to samples and a playing order? Assuming this is insanely hard to do, can you do it for a restricted set/layout/etc. of songs, and/or with human interaction?</li>
	<li>Would the sampled version offer better quality/compression? This depends on loads of things, like track length, repetitiveness, how well you can store the samples themselves (lots of little dissimilar files tend to be harder to compress than a long one), etc.</li>
	<li>Assuming it does, and the artists are in on it (ie. you don't have to do the conversion), would this help with music distribution? How small can you get a 70min CD?</li>
	<li>Can people with "different" hearing to me distinguish between guitars/other string instruments in anything but the simplest of songs?</li>
	<li>If so, does people's varying ability to "focus" on the music change their enjoyment of it?</li>
	<li>What would you do with partially discrete instruments like pianos, where more than one key can be held at once, producing a subtly different sound. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">88</a> samples or one sample and fiddle the frequency? Fading off over time? Fall back to what'd have to be done with voice: try and seperate out "verses" of piano, and have them as a sample? <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/track/85140f99-fcd2-4f4d-9d93-86a6511111b8.html" title="Show track at MusicBrainz"><b>Piano Track</b></a> would be particularily susceptible to that.</li>
	<li>Could one design a game based on people's ability to pick out instruments/number of channels? It'd have to be more fun than <abbr title="Dance Dance Revolution">DDR</abbr> and Guitar Hero. ;)</li>
	<li>Do I really think that I can rate tracks simply on the number of channels they'd require to compose, ie. their compressability? ie., for ogg, <a href="http://faux.uwcs.co.uk/perm/chrislake_changes.svg" title="Graph of bitrate/time in Chris Lake - Changes">Chris Lake - Changes</a> <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/track/10e3eb67-ddd3-4178-b0dd-f3756f1584ae.html" title="Show track at MusicBrainz">(musicbrainz)</a> (generated by <a href="http://kurtnoise.free.fr/index.php?dir=misc/&file=oggspot.zip">oggspot</a> and sed).</li>
	<li>..and so on.</li>
