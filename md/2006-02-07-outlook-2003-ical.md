I was trying today to get Outlook 2003 to accept an iCal feed (which turned out to be horribly out-of-date), but never mind. Dropping the file onto Outlook imported the first item in it, importing it using the Import wizard seemed to work, but this still wasn't quite what I wanted, the idea was to "subscribe" to the calendar feed.

The trick is to use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotecalendars/">Remote Calendars</a>, worked straight away. 

Thanks Alex, and 'Matt'.
