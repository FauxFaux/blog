Recently I switched this blog, and my other sites, over from <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> to <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>, which, along with having a much lower memory footprint, seems to be faster (with <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI</a>) than mod_php.

This was as an attempted response to this blog's terrible uptime, it seems that with certain versions of libc6 (2.3.6-7), such as the ones that have recently entered into <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">Debian Testing</a> cause mysql to be unstable under <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/" title="User Mode Linux">UML</a>, which is what my hosts, <a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk/">Bytemark</a>, use. It didn't help, although a recent libc6 update (2.3.6-13) seems to have improved things somewhat.

Now, assuming here that people actually read my blog, it's been submitted to various sites, such as <a href="http://planet.uwcs.co.uk/">Planet CompSoc</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/blog.prelode.com">Technorati</a>. Once there's some relevant content, it'll hopefully end up on <a href="http://planet3yp.chris-lamb.co.uk/">Planet 3yp</a>, too.

Last thing, I dislike <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>' default theme, on account of it being fixed width, and failing to render correctly in <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>. The theming engine is hindering my work on an alternate theme, having failed to find one I like. <a href="http://ultima-inet.kicks-ass.org/~multima/wordpress/?page_id=10">Flex</a>, a css-only theme for WordPress, may be able to save me some grief here.
