title: Announcing TinyJar

I've just uploaded a first release of <a href="https://github.com/FauxFaux/tinyjar">tinyjar</a> to github.

It takes a runnable jar and emits a much smaller runnable jar.  For my current project, <em>CODENAME GUJ</em>:
<ul>
<li>guj-maven-shade.jar: 14MB</li>
<li>guj-maven-shade-minimised.jar: 7MB</li>
<li>guj-tiny.jar: 2.8MB</li>
</ul>

Noting that maven-shade-minimised.jar doesn't start (as it deletes half of Spring, as it can't see it's needed as it's only accessed via. reflection), this is an <strong>80% reduction</strong>.  Not bad.  It should work for any runnable jar.

TinyJar works by running the jar through <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/pack200.html">pack200</a>, then through <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html">LZMA</a>.  Neither are new technologies, but they are rather slow, even during unpacking.  It adds at least a few seconds to application start as it unpacks the application to the temporary directory.

I thought this would be simpler than using a <a href="http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/">one-jar</a>-style jar-in-jar classloader.. on the stream coming out of the decompressor.. in some way.. etc.
