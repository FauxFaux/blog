My name is Chris West. I live in London, UK.

I'm a developer. I love developing. And sysadmin. I'm currently interested in
mostly-remote, part-time contracts.
[Hire me](mailto:solo-hire-7@goeshewere.com).
Please don't waste my time by sending me full time positions; I will just mark
your mail as spam, without reading your justification.

I've previously worked for a machine learning fintech startup, a major
British broadcasting corporation, a payroll company, and a JVM vendor.

I'm around the internet in various places as Faux or FauxFaux, mostly linked down the side.
