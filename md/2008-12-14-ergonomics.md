I decided on Thursday that I don't actually use my right-thumb for any keys whilst typing, my left exclusively operates the space-bar, and there are no useful modifier keys on the right-hand side of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043">Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard</a>.

I decided to add something useful:

If you can't tell by the head, it's the remains of an xbox 360 controller:

This, combined with a modified version of <a href="//b.goeswhere.com/mousex.cpp">mousex</a> gives you an almost usable mouse.

Now I just need to train myself to use it.

As an aside, I used to be worried about damaging the wrist wrests and the other pieces of the body (both of which you can see mutilated above). I am no longer, they're almost indestructable. I had to switch from a craft knife to a stanley knife to get through the faux-leather on the wrist wrest.
