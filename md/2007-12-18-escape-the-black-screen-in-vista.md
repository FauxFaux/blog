I've used this so many times today, I just have to share it.

Occasionally, when tabbing out of legacy games/<a href="http://libsdl.org/">SDL</a>/<a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">dosbox</a>/etc. under Vista (on my machine? New in <a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/12/12/windows-vista-sp1-rc-now-available-for-public-download.aspx">Vista sp1 beta</a>? With the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/betadrivers.aspx">beta nVidia drivers</a>?), the screen will go completely black, but everything underneath will continue working, the mouse cursor will continue to move and change.

Ctrl+shift+esc (show task-manager), start+d (show desktop) and the usual set of keys don't make the black go away, nor does Ctrl+alt+delete.

The trick is to lock the machine (start+L), the screen will remain black, it's useful to have sound on at this point to ensure that it actually locked (ie. you aren't about to type your password into IRC :) ) and log back in again. Everything will return to normal. I have no idea why this fixes it. :)
