I was checking the specification for XML earlier to try and work out how you are supposed to escape stuff that goes in CDATA blocks. Anyway, I found the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006.html#sec-origin-goals">Origins and Goals section of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition) specification</a>.

Number 4 made be laugh, "It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.".

I'm yet to see a stateless XML parser, let alone one written in clean regular expressions.

Apps that needlessly use XML over (perfectly addequte) .ini files (with the same structure) also cause themselves much pain.

Why?
