The iRivers completely murdered the iPod's in reviews this christmas.. 

When the sales figures come out it'll be really interesting to see what percentage of the population care about functionality over percieved-style/advertising.

Having spoken to a few (female) friends from school who were yet to actually hear of "mp3s", so were completely uninterested in "mp3 players" that wern't iPod's, I'm not particularily hopeful.
