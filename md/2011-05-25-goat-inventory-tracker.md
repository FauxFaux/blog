The year is <abbr title="sometime in the (near?) future">1516</abbr>.  The <abbr title="software development revolution">Royal Mail</abbr> has just been founded.

You're an enterprising <abbr title="software engineer">goat farmer</abbr>.  You want to service requests for <abbr title="software changes">goats</abbr> by <abbr title="bug tracker">mail</abbr>.  You have multiple <abbr title="files">paddocks</abbr>.  <abbr title="Files">Paddocks</abbr> contain multiple <abbr title="outstanding hunks">goats</abbr>.

<abbr title="A bug report">An order</abbr> comes in for some <abbr title="code fixes">goats</abbr>.  You spring into <abbr title="the kitchen to get some coke">action</abbr>!

Firstly, you need to select some <abbr title="code that fixes the issue">goats</abbr> to send out.

<hr />

For this, you've designed a tool called the <abbr title="Goat Inventory Tracker">Goat Inventory Tracker</abbr>.  It deals with all the management aspects, so you can do what you love most; <abbr title="software engineering">breeding goats</abbr>.

You decree, <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git add -p">Goat Inventory Tracker, Allow Me To Pick From My Goats</abbr>!

The Goat Inventory Tracker shows you each of your <abbr title="hunks">goats</abbr> across all of your <abbr title="files">paddocks</abbr>, and asks you if you would like to include it.  If you do, it takes the <abbr title="hunk">goat</abbr> and places it in <abbr title="the staging area">a pending crate</abbr>.

When you're done selecting <abbr title="hunks">goats</abbr>, you can <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git status">look</abbr> into the <abbr title="staging area">pending crate</abbr> and check everything is what you want.  If it helps, you can <abbr class="gitcmd" title="use git stash --keep-index to view">preview</abbr> your <abbr title="working tree">shipping log</abbr> as if you had no outstanding <abbr title="hunks">goats</abbr>.  

This is important, as you're required to maintain <abbr title="passing tests">various arbitary constraints</abbr> by the local <abbr title="land ba..development manager">land baron</abbr>.

Now that you're happy, you can decree <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git commit">Goat Inventory Tracker, Seal This Box</abbr>!

This will, obviously, <abbr title="commit">seal</abbr> the <abbr title="commit">box</abbr> of <abbr title="hunks">goats</abbr>, and place it <abbr title="in your local history">near the post box</abbr> with a <abbr title="commit message">shipping note</abbr> of your choice.

<hr />

You repeat this procedure for a couple of <abbr title="cokes">days</abbr>.  During this time, loads of <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr> pile up <abbr title="locally">near the mail point</abbr>.

You don't like mess.

You decree, <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git rebase --interactive @{upstream}">Goat Inventory Tracker, Allow Me To Rearrange My Boxes</abbr>!

You are then able to reorder, <abbr title="reword">change the shipping note of</abbr>, <abbr title="squash">merge</abbr>, and <abbr title="edit">completely change or split</abbr> your <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr>.

<hr />

<img class="inline" style="width:150px;height:205px" src="/files/postman_pat.jpg" alt="Postman Pat, Postman Pat, Postman Pat and his black and white cat.  EARLY IN THE MORNING, JUST AS DAY IS DAWNING..."/>

Once you're happy with your outstanding <abbr title="commits">orders</abbr>, you can decree <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git push">Goat Inventory Tracker, Summon The Postman</abbr>!

<abbr title="(Tiny parts of) git fetch will run">The postman will arrive</abbr>, and will then check he can load your <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr> into his <abbr title="history(?)">wagon</abbr>.  Due to safety concerns, the <abbr title="push process">postman</abbr> isn't allowed to pile your <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr> on top of other people's <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr>, or allowed to re-order other people's <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr>.  This means that if <abbr title="upstream has moved on since your last pull">he has any boxes in his van already</abbr>, you'll need to do some work first.

<hr />

No worry; you just decree <abbr class="gitcmd" title="git pull --rebase">Goat Inventory Tracker, Pile My Boxes Atop These Lowly Boxes</abbr>!  It will.

Sometimes your <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr> won't <abbr title="apply">fit nicely</abbr> on top of the other people's, at which point the Goat Inventory Tracker will <abbr title="pani..conflict">panic</abbr>, and you'll need to <abbr title="resolve">reshape</abbr> your <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr>.  Remember that the Goat Inventory Tracker has many tools for dealing with <abbr title="commits">boxes</abbr>, as explained above.

Once you're done piling your boxes, the <abbr title="push process">postman</abbr> will be happy and will <abbr title="have placed your commits in upstream">leave with your boxes</abbr>, and you have entered them into your <abbr title="history">account book</abbr>.

<hr />

You've made some money, you've made your customers happy, and you've done basically no work. Excellent.  Back to <abbr title="fixing the code">breeding goats</abbr>.
