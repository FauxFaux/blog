I thought that, on account of being an Evil Windows User(tm), I should try installing Linux again.

I picked <a href="http://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>, because it's supposed to be the friendliest distro for Evil Windows Users.. I decided to download the beta (yes, a review based on a beta! Shock!), seeing as how everyone seems to think it's great and stable and fine, etc.

My experience:
<ol>	<li><a href="http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=616&slide=1">The splash screen (screenshot from old version)</a> doesn't support my USB keyboard, not so much of a problem, the default option was "Start Kubuntu", which was what I was after.</li>
	<li>The system hung, displaying:
<code>.
Decompressing Linux...Done.
Booting the kernel.
</code>
When I say "hung", I mean that it made no further progress, and had no apparent disk activity for 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>

Great.
