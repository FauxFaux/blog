Something I learned today..

Windows XP's explorer doesn't appear support long path names (ie. paths over MAX_PATH, 260 characters long), neither do the <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">GnuWin32 utils</a>. 

This is a major pain, if, for some strange reason (don't ask) you happen to have <em>accidentially</em> created a large number of folders called "foo", each being a child of the next.. you can't delete or browse them, the only operation that works is move (rename).

Simple solution; run the following a few times:

<pre>for /F "usebackq" %f in (`seq 1 500`) do mv foo foo2 & mv foo2\foo . & rm -r foo2</pre>

Oh, such a nasty hack.

For anyone who doesn't have a clue what's going on there, all it does is (500 times):
Rename 'foo' to 'foo2'.
Move 'foo2''s first child to the current directory.
Delete (the now empty) 'foo2'.

Simple, eh?
