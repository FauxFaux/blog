I've released an updated version of PuTTY Tray to <a href="http://puttytray.goeswhere.com/">puttytray.goeswhere.com</a>, <del datetime="2011-12-21T11:36:45+00:00">direct download: <a href="http://b.goeswhere.com/putty-tray-v004/putty.exe">putty.exe p0.61-t004</a></del> please see the site for the latest version and details.

This is a fork of <a href="http://haanstra.eu/putty/">Barry Haanstra's PuTTY Tray</a>, which is abandoned.

Main advantages:
<ul>
<li>Now built against <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html">PuTTY 0.61</a>, getting features like Windows 7 Jumplist and Aero support, and four years of core PuTTY development</li>
<li>Ctrl+mousewheel zoom support</li>
<li>URL detection works on URLs ending with close-brackets</li>
<li>Much easier to continue development of, build script generator works and source, issue and pull-request tracking provided by <a href="https://github.com/FauxFaux/PuTTYTray">github</a>.</li>
</ul>

Please <a href="https://github.com/FauxFaux/PuTTYTray/issues/new">raise a bug</a> if you have any problems or requests!
