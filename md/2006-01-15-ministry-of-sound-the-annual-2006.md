Having previewed the new Annual from the <a href="http://www.ministryofsound.com/">Ministry of Sound</a>, and christmas having passed, I thought it was time to go buy it.

Unfortunately, thanks to the Ministry of Sound's infinite wisdom, the box that looks like <a href="http://shop.diverseuniverse.net/images/products/617465134128/mos2006.jpg" title="CD Cover, courtesy of DiverseUniverse.net">this</a> contains completely different cds to the box that looks like <a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/B000BJ62UC.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" title="CD Cover, courtesy of Amazon UK">this</a>.

Can't spot the difference? Have a look at <a href="http://shop.diverseuniverse.net/product/3157/Ministry-of-Sound-Annual-2006.html">the track list, according to DreamUniverse</a> against <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BJ62UC/026-6440794-3549237">Amazon's attempt</a>. Ah.

I was after the version DreamUniverse are selling, for it's version of Hi Tack - Say Say Say, but I'm not paying for a company I've never heard of to ship me a cd that they probably don't even have a reliable track list for.

Back to 'sampling' it is for me, congratulations, Ministry of Sound, you just lost yourself another sale.
