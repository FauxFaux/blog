[xlines](https://github.com/FauxFaux/tinies/blob/master/xlines.c)
is a combination of `xargs` and `split`.  It takes a bunch of lines,
and sends them to a number of child processes.  Each process sees
only one of the lines.

e.g.

    seq 16 | xlines -c 'cat > $(mktemp)'

...will give you 8 temporary files (on an 8-core machine) containing:

    1
    9

and:

    2
    10

etc.

Why would you care?

You have a bunch of `INSERT` statements coming off a stream, but your
database will only use a single core if you run them in series:

    zcat sql.gz | xlines -P 32 -- psql

Some speed-up.

    zcat sql.gz | xlines -P 32 -c 'buffer | psql'

Zoom.

A specific tool to fix a specific job.  I still don't think it makes up
for the lack of limited parallelism in shell, however.  Still thinking about
that one...
