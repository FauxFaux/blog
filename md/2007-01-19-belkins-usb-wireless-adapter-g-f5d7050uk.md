Dear Belkin, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">choice makes humans sad</a>. 

<a href="http://web.belkin.com/support/download/download.asp?query=f5d7050&lang=1&mode=&Search=Search">Which f5d7050</a> do I have? No idea.

As usual, the device has a huge <strong>STOP: Run the Installation CD-ROM </strong><strong>FIRST</strong>. Inserting the CD and clicking "install" gets me:

<pre>---------------------------
Belkin Wireless USB Utility
---------------------------
Click on icon if you want to communicate directly to another wireless computer near you (Ad-Hoc).
---------------------------
OK
---------------------------</pre>

...and then disappears.

I decided, at random, to download the latest version of the drivers for Windows XP, ie. <a href="http://web.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?lang_id=1&file_id=2599">f5d7050-ver4.exe</a>, a tiny 28<abbr title="megabytes">MB</abbr>, which do exactly the same as the CD.

A <a href="http://www.rarlabs.com/">WinRAR</a> extract of the download (eventually) yields a folder called <code>Driver</code> containing the necessary Windows driver files for 98 thru XP. Total compressed size of the necessary parts of the <code>Driver</code> folder that are needed for XP? 120<abbr title="kilobytes">kB</abbr>. I don't even want to know what <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/10/tech-microsoft.html">craplets</a> were bundled along with the driver.

<strong>Result:</strong> A working wireless network card having completely ignored all of the warnings from the packaging, setup, installer, manual, etc. and only the final step, installing the (non-<abbr title="Windows Hardware Quality Lab certification">WHQL'd</abbr>) driver, as Administrator.


And people wonder why it's the technically inept that have all the problems with their <abbr title="Operating Systems">OSes</abbr>...
