My phone, after being in my pocket for ~10 months:

Ignoring that, the device still works perfectly, unfortunately I can't remember enough of the start-menu (and the file browser) to get stuff running, I think it'd be a wonderful experiment to find some software catering for the blind, see how well it copes&lt;/desperate&gt;. :)

<strong>Update:</strong>

Some searching revealed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=74473fd6-1dcc-47aa-ab28-6a2b006edfe9">Windows Mobile Developer Power Toys</a>, one of which provides a VNC-style server and client that you can run without local to the phone (except via. activesync):

Yay!
